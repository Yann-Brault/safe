\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1) Analysis Speed-up:} How much analysis time is reduced by
    adding dynamic shortcut to static analysis?
  \item \textbf{RQ2) Precision Improvement:} How much analysis precision is
    improved by replacing the manual modeling with dynamic shortcut?
  \item \textbf{RQ3) Opaque Function Coverage:} How many opaque functions are
    covered by dynamic shortcut without using manual modeling?
\end{itemize}
