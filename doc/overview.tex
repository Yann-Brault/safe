\chapter{Overview}

The prevalent uses of JavaScript in web programming have revealed
security vulnerability issues of JavaScript applications,
which emphasizes the need for JavaScript analyzers to detect such issues.
Recently, researchers have proposed several analyzers of JavaScript programs
and some web service companies have developed various JavaScript engines.
However, unfortunately, most of the tools are not documented well,
thus it is very hard to understand and modify them.
Or, such tools are often not open to the public.


In this specification, we present formal specifications and implementation
of \safe, a scalable analysis framework for ECMAScript, developed for the JavaScript research community.
To make it more amenable for other researchers to use our framework,
we formally define three kinds of intermediate representations for JavaScript
used in the framework,
and we provide formal specifications of translation between them.
To support a variety of program analyses in various compilation phases,
we design the framework to be as flexible, scalable, and pluggable as possible.
Finally, our framework is publicly available:

Our project has been supported by
Korea Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST),
National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF),
Samsung Electronics,
S-Core,
Microsoft Research Asia, and
Google.
